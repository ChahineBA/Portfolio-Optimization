# Portfolio Optimization for S&P 500 Stocks 📈💰

This project focuses on optimizing a portfolio of S&P 500 stocks by allocating percentages for each stock to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Using the `yfinance` 📊 library for data retrieval and the `pypfopt` 📉 library for optimization, I conducted a detailed analysis of various stocks, applying financial principles and optimization techniques.

## Key Features:
- **Stock Selection** 🏦: Analyzed and selected S&P 500 stocks for portfolio inclusion.
- **Data Retrieval** 🔍: Utilized `yfinance` to fetch historical stock data for analysis.
- **Optimization Techniques** ⚙️: Employed the `pypfopt` library to perform portfolio optimization based on expected returns and risk.
- **Dynamic Allocation** 💡: Allocated percentages for each selected stock to create a balanced portfolio.

### Libraries Used:
